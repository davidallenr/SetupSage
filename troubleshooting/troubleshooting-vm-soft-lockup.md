### Guide: Troubleshooting `watchdog: BUG: soft lockup` Errors in Proxmox VM

---

#### 1. Check Disk Health (Your Discovered Solution)

**Primary Indicator:** `watchdog: BUG: soft lockup` errors in VMs running on Proxmox.

Before diving into complex troubleshooting, verify the health of the physical disk where your VM's storage is located. A failing or unstable disk can lead to a myriad of issues, including the error above.

- **Check ZFS Pool Status**:

  If you're using ZFS, run the following command to get the status of your pools:

  ```bash
  zpool status
  ```

  Look for any indications of errors or disk issues.

- **Consider Disk Replacement**:

  If the disk shows signs of errors, or if you've historically used a brand of SSDs that may not be as reliable, consider replacing it with a known reliable brand, like Samsung.

  After replacement, create a new ZFS datastore on it and migrate the VM's storage to the new SSD.

#### 2. Check for Over-Provisioning

Ensure the Proxmox host isn't over-provisioned. Avoid allocating more virtual CPUs to your VMs than physical cores available, unless there's a specific requirement.

#### 3. System Updates

Update your Proxmox system, VM OS, kernel, and drivers:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
```

#### 4. Inspect Logs

Investigate system logs for clues:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i error
journalctl -xe
```

#### 5. Hardware Tests

Run hardware tests on the Proxmox host. Use tools like `memtest86` for RAM and `stress-ng` or `stress` for CPU testing.

#### 6. Tweak Kernel Parameters

Consider adjusting kernel parameters like `kernel.watchdog_thresh`. This is advanced and should be approached with caution.

#### 7. Check VM Settings

Ensure you're using VirtIO drivers where necessary. Ensure the host system has adequate resources for the VM.

#### 8. Consult Community and Forums

Look for known issues or solutions related to specific kernel versions, drivers, or Proxmox in forums or community spaces.

#### 9. Try Different Kernel Versions

If the kernel is suspected, boot with a different kernel version (older or newer) and observe the results.

### Conclusion

While `watchdog: BUG: soft lockup` errors can be alarming, a systematic approach to troubleshooting, starting with physical disk health checks, can help identify and resolve the root cause.
